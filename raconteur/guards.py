"""Deterministic guards — the polestar, made mechanical.

raconteur exists to produce a grounded, verifiable manuscript: every substantive claim
traceable to the material it was given (litreview, methods writeup, results, one-pager),
and every ``[@citekey]`` resolvable against ``refs.bib``. A Methods paragraph describing an
algorithm the writeup never mentions, or a Background paragraph that cites nothing, is a
defect — not a matter of taste.

The division of labour, applied everywhere in the codebase:

    Python decides THAT something is wrong, precisely, and states it as an imperative.
    The LLM decides only what cannot be computed — whether prose reads as synthesis rather
    than a list, whether a claim is actually supported.

Two families:

  VERIFIABILITY — a claim severed from what grounds it. A dropped [@citekey], an
    unresolvable key, a dropped equation. Each looks founded and is not. These run on the
    DRAFT path, where fuller grounding is the goal.

  MINIMALITY — a redline is surgical. The set of sentences a reviser touched is computed,
    not estimated, so "you rewrote sentences the comment did not bear on" stops being an
    LLM judgement call. These run on the REDLINE path.

Scoping rule (important): density guards must NEVER run on the redline path. A comment like
"tighten this sentence" would otherwise cause the reviser to inject citations into the
paragraph to satisfy a citation floor — density demands more sources, minimality forbids
collateral change, and both are correct. Different passes, different guard sets. Every guard
below is tagged with its PHASE.

Second scoping rule: the citation floor is gated on SECTION KIND. A Methods or Results
paragraph is grounded in the methods writeup and the results files, not in the bibliography.
Demanding citations there is wrong.

Everything here is a pure function over text and the parsed bib: no I/O, no LLM, no docx.
